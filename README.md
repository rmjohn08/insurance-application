Prototype for concepts on eapp form validation redesign.  
What I am using here is Angular 5 with Material Design.  MD is in beta and evolving but it is 
gaining more support on new angular versions (v6). MD is a specification for a unified system of 
visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices, and the goal is to deliver
lightweight UI elements.
